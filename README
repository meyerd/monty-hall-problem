Monty-Hall-Problem
==================

(German: Ziegenproblem, Drei-TÃ¼ren-Problem, Monty-Hall-Problem, Monty-Hall-Dilemma)

This is a small python experimental implementation of the Monty-Hall-Problem. It was
implemented because I couldn't believe the math and probability. But I guess math once
more proved right here ...
